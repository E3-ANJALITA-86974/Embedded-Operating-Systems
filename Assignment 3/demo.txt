Q. What is an Operating System?
• An OS is a system software (i.e. collection of system programs) which acts as an interface between
End user and hardware.
• An OS also acts as an interface between computer programs and computer hardware.
• An OS controls an execution of all programs and it also controls hardware devices which are
connected to the computer system and hence it is also called as a control program.
• An OS manages limited available resources among all running programs, hence it is also called as a
resource manager.
• An OS allocates resources like main memory, CPU time, i/o devices access etc... to all running
programs, hence it is also called as a resource allocator.
